NGINX Plus API Dynamic Configuration
====================================

Introduction
------------

NGINX Plus enables configuration of upstream servers in a server group
to be modified on-the-fly without reloading the NGINX servers and its
configuration files. This is useful for:

-  **Autoscaling**, when you need to add more servers
-  **Maintenance**, when you need to remove a server, specify a backup
   server, or take a server down temporarily
-  **Quick setup**, when you need to change upstream server settings
   such as server weight, active connections, slow start, failure
   timeouts.
-  **Monitoring**, when you get the state of the server or server group
   with one command

All these changes are made with the NGINX Plus REST API. 
By default changes made with the API are only stored only in the shared memory
zone and so the changes are discarded when the NGINX Plus configuration file
is reloaded.

In this Module we will configure upstream servers and upstream server
groups dynamically (on-the-fly) with the NGINX Plus REST API and use the
**state** directive so on-the-fly configurations persistent through
NGINX reloads.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of the lab you will be able to:

-  Use the NGINX Plus API to dynamicly configure NGINX upstreams groups
-  Persist dyanmic reconfigurations using a **state** file
-  Interact with the NGINX Plus API using both
   `Postman <https://www.postman.com>`__ and
   `cURL <https://curl.haxx.se>`__

Exercise 1: Dynamic Configuration of an Upstream using the NGINX API using Postman
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will use **Postman** to interact with the NGINX API.
In the Optional section below, we can reproduce the same steps using
**curl**

#. In the **WORKSPACE** folder found on the desktop, double click the
   **NGINX-PLUS-1** workspace shortcut to open Visual Studio Code

    .. image:: ../images/2020-06-29_15-55.png

#. In the VSCode, open a **terminal window**, by selecting **View > Terminal**.
   You will now be able to both run NGINX commands and edit NGINX Plus
   configuration files via the VSCode Console and terminal.

    .. image:: ../images/2020-06-29_16-02_1.png

#. Now inspect the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/upstreams.conf** file. Note the
   following:

    -  The **zone** directive configures a zone in the shared memory and
       sets the zone name and size. The configuration of the server
       group is kept in this zone, so all worker processes use the same
       configuration. In our example, the **zone** is also named
       **dynamic** and is **64k** in size.

    -  The **state** directive configures Persistence of Dynamic
       Configuration by writing the state information to a file that
       persists during a reload. The recommended path for Linux
       distributions is **/var/lib/nginx/state/**

       .. code:: nginx

          # /etc/nginx/conf.d/upstream.conf 

          upstream dynamic {
              # Specify a file that keeps the state of the dynamically configurable group:
              state /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf;

              zone dynamic 64k;

              # Including keep alive connections are bonus points
              keepalive 32;
          }

#. In the Terminal window, on the NGINX plus instance, ensure that the
   **state** file is at a empty state for this demo. Delete the file
   (if exists), then create an empty file:

   .. code:: bash

      rm /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf
      
   .. note:: You may receive the following if the file doesn't exist
      
      rm: cannot remove '/var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf': 
      No such file or directory

   Then run:

   .. code:: bash

      touch /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

#. In a Web Browser, open the NGINX dashboard on
   `http://www.example.com:8080/dashboard.html <http://www.example.com:8080/dashboard.html>`__.
   There is a bookmark in the Chrome Web Browser **Nginx+ Dashboard**.
   Navigate to **HTTP Upstreams**, and note that the **dynamic** is empty.

    .. image:: ../images/2020-06-23_16-26.png

#. Open **Postman** found on the desktop. For this demo we would will make use
   of the **Dynamic Configuration** collection.

#. Open **Check dynamic servers** request and execute the call by
   clicking on the **Send** button. We can confirm the empty state of our 
   upstream, **dynamic**, from the response that we receive from the NGINX API.

   .. image:: ../images/dc1_2020-08-26.png

#. Let's add two servers, **web1** (``10.1.1.5:80``) and **web2**
    (``10.1.1.6:80``) to the **dynamic** upstream group using the API.

    Open **Add web1 to dynamic** and **Add web2 to dynamic** requests
    and run them as shown below.

   .. image:: ../images/dc2_2020-08-26.png

   .. image:: ../images/dc3_2020-08-26.png

#. Lets now add **web3** (``10.1.1.7:80``), **marked as down**, to the
   **dynamic** upstream group using the API.

    .. image:: ../images/dc4_2020-08-26.png

#. Once again, we can list the servers in our upstream, **dynamic**, and
    view the changes made.  Run the **Check dynamic servers** collection in
    **Postman** to view the changes.

    .. image:: ../images/dc5_2020-08-26.png

#. We can also confirm that the state file has been updated:

      .. code:: bash

         cat /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf
      
      .. note:: You should see output similar to the following

        | server 10.1.1.5:80;
        | server 10.1.1.6:80;
        | server 10.1.1.7:80 slow_start=10s backup down;

#. It is possible to also remove a server from the upstream group:

    .. image:: ../images/dc6_2020-08-26.png

#. To add our **down** server back to the rotation and accept live
    traffic, we need to change the server parameter from **down: true**
    to **down: false**. First, we must find the server ID:

    Run the **Check dynamic servers** request to get the list of
    servers. From the response body note down the **id** value for the
    block that has the server parameter **down: true**

    .. image:: ../images/dc7_2020-08-26.png

#. Now that we have identified the server id, (e.g. **"id: 2"**) we can
   modify the **down** parameter:

   Click the **Update web3** patch request. Before sending the request
   take a look at the **Body** of the request in Postman by clicking the **Body**
   link just below the **PATCH** request. Afterweards, click **Send** to modify
   the **Down** parameter.

    .. image:: ../images/dc8_2020-08-26.png
       
#. Once again, list our servers in our upstream, **dynamic**

    .. image:: ../images/dc10_2020-08-27.png

#. We can check that the **state** file is making our upstream changes
   persistent by reloading NGINX and checking the dashboard and API.

   .. code:: bash

      cat /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

   .. note:: You should see output similar to the following

      ::

         server 10.1.1.5:80;
         server 10.1.1.6:80;
         server 10.1.1.7:80 slow_start=10s backup;

   # Reload NGINX

      .. code:: bash

         nginx -s reload

   .. note:: After a NGINX reload, the server **id** is reset to start at **0**:

Optional: Dynamic Configuration of an Upstream using the NGINX API using cURL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will use **curl** to interact with the NGINX API.

#. In the **WORKSPACE** folder found on the desktop, open
   **NGINX-PLUS-1** in Visual Studio Code

.. image:: ../images/2020-06-29_15-55.png

#. In VSCode, open a **terminal window** by selecting **View > Terminal**
   command. You will now be able to both run NGINX commands and edit NGINX
   Plus configuration files via the VSCode Console and terminal.

   .. image:: ../images/2020-06-29_16-02_1.png

#. Now inspect the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/upstreams.conf** file. Note the
   following:

   -  The **zone** directive configures a zone in the shared memory and
      sets the zone name and size. The configuration of the server group
      is kept in this zone, so all worker processes use the same
      configuration. In our example, the **zone** is also named
      **dynamic** and is **64k** megabyte in size.

   -  The **state** directive configures Persistence of Dynamic
      Configuration by writing the state information to a file that
      persists during a reload. The recommended path for Linux
      distributions is **/var/lib/nginx/state/**

      .. code:: nginx

         # /etc/nginx/conf.d/upstream.conf 

         upstream dynamic {
             # Specify a file that keeps the state of the dynamically configurable group:
             state /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf;

             zone dynamic 64k;

             # Including keep alive connections are bonus points
             keepalive 32;
         }

#. In the Terminal window, on the NGINX plus instance, ensure that the
   **state** file is at a empty state for this demo. Delete the file
   (if exists), then create an empty file:

   .. code:: bash

      rm /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf
      
   .. note:: You may receive the following if the file doesn't exist
      
      rm: cannot remove '/var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf': 
      No such file or directory

   Next, lets restart NGINX to make sure changes are reflected in the UI:

   .. code:: bash

      nginx -s reload

   Then run:

   .. code:: bash

      touch /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

#. In a Web Browser, open the NGINX dashboard on
   `http://www.example.com:8080/dashboard.html <http://www.example.com:8080/dashboard.html>`__.
   There is a bookmark in the Chrome Web Browser **Nginx+ Dashboard**.
   Navigate to **HTTP Upstreams**, and note that the **dynamic** is empty.

    .. image:: ../images/2020-06-23_16-26.png

#. In the Terminal window, we can also confirm the empty state of our
   upstream, **dynamic**, using a **curl** command to retrieve this information
   from the NGINX API.

   .. code:: bash

      curl -s http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers | jq

   .. note:: Am empty array should return
   
      []

#. Let's add two servers, **web1** (``10.1.1.5:80``) and **web2**
    (``10.1.1.6:80``) to the **dynamic** upstream group using the API

    .. code:: bash

      curl -s -X \
      POST http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers \
      -H 'Content-Type: text/json; charset=utf-8' \

   .. code:: bash

      curl -s -X \
      POST http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers \
      -H 'Content-Type: text/json; charset=utf-8' \
      -d '{

    .. code:: bash

      curl -s -X \

    .. image:: ../images/2020-06-29_21-56.png
      
#. Once again, we can list the servers in our upstream, **dynamic**, and
   view the changes made.

   .. code:: bash

      curl -s http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers | jq

   .. code:: json

      [
         {

         }
      ]

#. We can also confirm that the state file has been updated:

   .. code:: bash

      cat /var/lib/nginx/state/servers.conf

   .. note:: You should receive output similar to the following

       server 10.1.1.6:80;
       server 10.1.1.7:80 slow_start=10s backup down;

#. It is possible to also remove a server from the upstream group:

   .. code:: bash

      curl -X DELETE -s http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers/0 | jq
   
   .. code:: json

            "down": true
         }
      ]

   .. image:: ../images/2020-06-29_21-58.png

#. To add our **down** server back to the rotation and accept live

    to **down: false**. First, we must find the server ID:

   .. code:: bash

   .. code:: json

      {
         "id": 2,
         "server": "10.1.1.7:80",
         "weight": 1,

#. Now that we have identified the server id, (e.g. **"id: 2"**) we can
    modify the **down** parameter:

   .. code:: bash

       curl -X PATCH -d '{ "down": false }' -s 'http://nginx-plus-1:8080/api/6/http/upstreams/dynamic/servers/2'

   # Reload NGINX
   
   .. code:: bash

      nginx -s reload

   .. note:: After a NGINX reload, the server **id** is reset to start at **0**:
