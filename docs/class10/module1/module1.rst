Module 1 - Deploying an API for a modern app
############################################

This class will deploy a modern API-driven app (API Sentence) in a state-of-the-art environment (K3S).

This application creates a sentence where each word is generated by a separate API endpoint/server (one server per word).

.. note:: If you want to deploy this application in your environment, you can find the project on Github : https://github.com/f5devcentral/sentence-demo-app
