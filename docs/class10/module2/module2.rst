Module 2 - Infrastructure team - Deploy Nginx instances
#######################################################

In this class, we will deploy 2 NGINX Plus instances (API GW and Dev Portal) and link these instances to NMS ACM.

.. note :: The Infrastructure team does this. The ``Infrastructure team`` is in charge of the Nginx Plus instances. They deploy and maintain Nginx Plus instances so that the ``API Team`` can deploy API on it.

.. warning :: All actions in the NMS UI must be done from the Win10 Jumphost RDP session

.. note :: Throughout this and the following labs, you may get a browser warning about invalid SSL certificates. This is normal and can be ignored.
